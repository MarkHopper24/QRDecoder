## Overview

QRDecoder is a lightweight, on-screen QR code decoding tool for Windows. It's built on top of Python and leverages the the Windows Snipping Tool/Snip & Sketch app for on-screen image selection. Simply install, launch, and crop to decode QR code images that are anywhere on your screen. 

This project is a work in progress. Pull-requests, suggestions, fixes, and feature requests are welcome.


## Usage

You can download and install the QRDecoder directly from GitHub [HERE](https://github.com/MarkHopper24/QRDecoder/blob/main/QRDecoderSetup.exe). Alternatively, you can install from the Microsoft Store [HERE](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/qrdecoder/XPDLKS1X6WLBKJ?hl=en-us&gl=US).

I've also included the following resources if you want to modify, compile, and package the application yourself:

* QRDecoder.py (standalone script)
* setup.py (for use with Cx_Freeze)

## Emailware

QRDecoder is an [emailware](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emailware). Meaning, if you liked using this app or it has helped you in any way, I'd like you send me an email at <mark.hopper24@gmail.com> about anything you'd want to say about this software. I'd really appreciate it!
