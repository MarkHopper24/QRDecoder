<h3 align="center">12/29/2023 QRDecoder Retirement: </h3>

Hi all, I have decided to retire QRDecoder. For the last year, all of my barcode/QR code app development has been focused on barcodrod.io. barcodrod.io is an ad-free, open source Windows 10/11 app that offers the same functionality as QRDecoder, but with many more features and improvements. While Python was great for the limited feature scope of QRDecoder, barcodrod.io being written in C# and built on .NET comes with numerous development benefits for a native Windows application, allowing much more rapid feature development. Learn more here:

Website: https://barcodrod.io <br>
GitHub: https://github.com/MarkHopper24/barcodrod.io <br>
Download it from GitHub or the Microsoft Store: https://download.bardcodrod.io <br>

With that said, I will no longer update or support QRDecoder, including breaking and/or critical security fixes. The app and source code will remain available on GitHub for historical purposes and can be forked, referenced, and repurposed as needed under the MIT license but I recommend migrating to barcodrod.io for general usage as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your support! QRDecoder has been a really fun learning project, and I hope you have enjoyed using it or learning along with me. ðŸ™‚

## Overview

QRDecoder is a lightweight, on-screen QR code decoding tool for Windows. It's built on top of Python and leverages the the Windows Snipping Tool/Snip & Sketch app for on-screen image selection. Simply install, launch, and crop to decode QR code images that are anywhere on your screen. 

This project is a work in progress. Pull-requests, suggestions, fixes, and feature requests are welcome.


## Usage

You can download and install the QRDecoder directly from GitHub [HERE](https://github.com/MarkHopper24/QRDecoder/blob/main/QRDecoderSetup.exe). Alternatively, you can install from the Microsoft Store [HERE](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/qrdecoder/9N6262B4T5CN?hl=en-us&gl=us).

I've also included the following resources if you want to modify, compile, and package the application yourself:

* QRDecoder.py (standalone script)
* setup.py (for use with Cx_Freeze)

## Emailware

QRDecoder is an [emailware](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/emailware). Meaning, if you liked using this app or it has helped you in any way, I'd like you send me an email at <mark.hopper24@gmail.com> about anything you'd want to say about this software. I'd really appreciate it!
